Stop the aliens from invading your zone by firing bullets on them, we start off with six aliens and they move side to side, you can move the spaceship using the arrow keys so everytime the aliens touch the edge of the screen they reverse course and they advance one  row you can fire at them by pressing the space bar, everytime you clear a group of aliens a bigger group appears so the goal of the aliens is to reach you and you have to fend them off by firing the bullets at them the more you eliminate the score increases and the game is over when the aliens reach the same row as you.
